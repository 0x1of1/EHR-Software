### Component Interaction

The system follows a layered architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Handles user interface and user interactions
2. **Application Layer**: Implements business logic and workflows
3. **Data Access Layer**: Manages database operations and data persistence
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Provides system services and external integrations

### Request Flow

1. User makes a request to the application
2. Nginx receives the request and routes it appropriately
3. For PHP requests, PHP-FPM processes the request
4. The application router directs the request to the appropriate controller
5. The controller interacts with models to fetch or update data
6. The view renders the response using templates
7. The response is sent back to the user

## Scalability Considerations

### Current Architecture Scalability

The current Docker-based architecture provides several scaling options:

#### Horizontal Scaling

- **Web Tier**: Multiple web server containers can be deployed behind a load balancer
- **Worker Processes**: Background task workers can be scaled independently
- **Database**: Read replicas can be added for read-heavy workloads

#### Vertical Scaling

- Increase container resources (CPU, memory)
- Upgrade database server specifications
- Optimize application code for better performance

### Scaling Limitations

- The current architecture may have limitations for very large deployments
- Some components may become bottlenecks under heavy load
- Database scaling requires additional configuration

### Scaling Recommendations

#### For Small to Medium Organizations (up to 1,000 employees)

- Standard Docker deployment is sufficient
- Regular database maintenance and optimization
- Periodic review of performance metrics

#### For Large Organizations (1,000+ employees)

- Implement load balancing for web servers
- Set up database replication
- Implement caching (Redis or Memcached)
- Consider microservices architecture for high-traffic modules

#### For Enterprise Deployments

- Kubernetes orchestration for container management
- Dedicated database clusters with sharding
- CDN for static assets
- Distributed caching
- Separate services for high-load functions

### Performance Optimization

- **Database Optimization**:

  - Proper indexing
  - Query optimization
  - Regular maintenance

- **Application Optimization**:

  - Code profiling and optimization
  - Caching frequently accessed data
  - Asynchronous processing for long-running tasks

- **Infrastructure Optimization**:
  - Content Delivery Networks for static assets
  - In-memory caching
  - Optimized server configurations
